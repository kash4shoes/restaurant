  <p><strong><center><em>Friend Chicken</em></center></strong></p>
<center>  Friend Chicken is opened up by a couple Ye and Kaoshoua who enjoyed eating out.
  Kaoshoua went to South Korea and had fried chicken that she's never had before in the United States.
  Inspired by South Korea's famous fried chicken, she came back to Minnesota and her and Ye searched up South Korea inspired chicken places in Minnesota.
  They realized that there were none and that Minnesota was missing out on a taste that can never be forgotten,
  just like that good old friend.</center>
